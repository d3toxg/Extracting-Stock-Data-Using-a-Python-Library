Extracting Share Price
A share is the single smallest part of a company's stock that you can buy, the prices of these shares fluctuate over time. Using the history() method we can get the share price of the stock over a certain period of time. Using the period parameter we can set how far back from the present to get data. The options for period are 1 day (1d), 5d, 1 month (1mo) , 3mo, 6mo, 1 year (1y), 2y, 5y, 10y, ytd, and max.

apple_share_price_data = apple.history(period="max")
apple_share_price_data.head()
apple_share_price_data.reset_index(inplace=True)
apple_share_price_data.plot(x="Date", y="Open")
